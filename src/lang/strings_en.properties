Weather resistance refers to the influence of external conditions such as sunlight, temperature changes, wind and rain, and housing materials such as roofs, wall hanging boards, cornices, scattered water, rubber products, etc., used in outdoor weather testing. A series of aging phenomena such as fading, discoloration, cracking, chalking and reduction in strength caused by comprehensive damage caused by light, cold, heat, wind and rain.
sting_hy_text1=That is, they have the ability to withstand various weather conditions, such as: rain and humidity in the south, snow or frost in the north. Given the integrity and completeness of the home, you can eliminate these problems in principle.
sting_hy_text2=Housing needs the most important features of climate change
sting_hy_text3=1. Weather resistance refers to the change in performance of a house in the natural environment after exposure to sunlight and wind and rain. Generally, the effect and basic performance of light steel villa products will not affect the use effect within 100 years.
sting_hy_text4=2. Weather resistance refers to its ability to resist natural factors. For most of the villa products that are neither immersed in water nor in corrosive media, the design and estimation of the aging life of the surface of the villa is mainly based on its weather resistance. Many of the natural factors that affect weather resistance are physical factors (heat, light, electricity).
sting_hy_text5=3. After the completion of the construction of the house, its color, structural strength and other properties, exposed to the outdoor nature under natural conditions, can be collectively referred to as the weather resistance of the house.
sting_hy_text6=The basic principle of Light Steel Villa construction is to meet more weather resistance and a hundred years of stainless, which is also a must for mature building systems.
sting_hy_text7=Light steel body is a hundred years old stainless
sting_hy_text8=Light steel keel is not affected by corrosion
sting_hy_text9=Light Steel Villas use galvanized steel keel, which is due to the protection of galvanized layers, so that the light steel keel have not been a problem on the walls for hundreds of years. Cold-formed thin-walled light steel coated with aluminum-zinc. The wet air cannot destroy light steel keel, it will not rust, steel plate will not be thinned, original strength and thickness can be maintained, and resistance to insulation is guaranteed. There will be no wall that sloshing, collapse, etc.
sting_hy_text10=Coated with zinc coating, damp air cannot destroy light steel keel, will not rust, steel plate will not be thin, will maintain the original strength. The thickness is guaranteed, the rigidity is guaranteed, and the impact resistance is ensured, so that the wall does not shake or collapse. <br><b> anti-corrosion Light steel house wall will guarantees comfort.
sting_hy_text11=1. Outdoor Wall
sting_hy_text12=Outdoor uses also use high-pressure cement fiber, high-density green building materials, which can completely isolate the entry of damp air and prevent direct exposure of metal structures to the outdoor corrosive environments. The high-pressure cement fiberboard seals the entire wall against moisture. This type of sealing can prevent harmful substances in the outdoor environment from corroding the metal materials while separating the outside moisture into the room, and can also exclude outdoor moisture.
sting_hy_text13=2. Wall Waterproof Layer
sting_hy_text14=The outer layer of the wall insulation layer is provided with a moisture-proof coating, and the moisture-proof gas-permeable membrane is a novel polymer material. The surface of the material has a very fine microporous structure, forming a one-way water-permeable and ventilating, since the minimum diameter of the water droplet is about 0.02 mm, and the water molecular vapor diameter is only 0.0000004 mm, and the two diameters are very different. According to the principle of diffusion the concentration gradient difference, the external water vapor cannot penetrate the wall, and moisture in the building can be dissipated from the wall.
sting_hy_text15=This type of sealing can prevent the harmful substances in the outdoor environment from destroying the metal while removing moisture outside the room, and can also eliminate the moisture in the room. The gypsum board used throughout the walls is also a breathable wall.
sting_hy_text16=Light steel window sill roof rainproof 
sting_hy_text17=guarantee that it has a protection facility

sting_hy_text20=Light steel houses have strong resilience to natural disasters.
sting_hy_text21=Shock Resistance
sting_hy_text22=Most of the low-rise villas have sloping roofs. Therefore, the roof structure essentially adopts a triangular roof truss system made of cold-formed steel members. After the steel sheet and gypsum board were sealed, light steel members form a very strong `The ribbed structural system`, this structural system has the ability to withstand earthquakes and withstand horizontal loads, and is suitable for areas with a seismic intensity of 8 degrees or more.
sting_hy_text23=Wind Resistance
sting_hy_text24=Light steel structure has light weight, high strength, good overall durability and strong deformation ability. The building itself weighs just one-fifth of the brick-concrete structure, which can withstand hurricanes up to 70 meters per second, so that life and property can be effectively protected.
sting_hy_text25=The light steel residential building construction technology is based on North American model timber structure construction technology. After more than 100 years of development, it has developed excellent physical property to withstand a variety of climates. Galvanized steel sheets used for building structures are corrosion resistant. Excellent performance and durability, light steel houses are also promoted as green environmental protection, traditional brick and concrete houses will gradually be eradicated, light steel will be grow at the historic building level.
